        Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the
        atmosphere—usually within clouds—and then fall, accumulating on the
        ground where they undergo further changes.[2] It consists of frozen
        crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under
        suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase
        to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then
        metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric
        moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the
        atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in
        hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic
        among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow
        accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time,
        accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and
        freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year
        accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts
        seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging
        groundwater.
      </p>
      <p>
        Major snow-prone areas include the polar regions, the northernmost half
        of the Northern Hemisphere and mountainous regions worldwide with
        sufficient moisture and cold temperatures. In the Southern Hemisphere,
        snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas, apart from
        Antarctica.
      </p>

        Snow affects such human activities as transportation: creating the need
        for keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture: providing
        water to crops and safeguarding livestock; sports such as skiing,
        snowboarding, and snowmachine travel; and warfare. Snow affects
        ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter
        under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.[1]
      </p>
      <p>
        Snow develops in clouds that themselves are part of a larger weather
        system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a
        complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures.
        The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be
        classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations thereof.
        Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes
        can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion
        present.

      <h2>Snow types</h2>
      <p>
        Snow flurry, snow shower, snow storm and blizzard describe snow events
        of progressively greater duration and intensity.[35] A blizzard is a
        weather condition involving snow and has varying definitions in
        different parts of the world. In the United States, a blizzard occurs
        when two conditions are met for a period of three hours or more: a
        sustained wind or frequent gusts to 35 miles per hour (56 km/h), and
        sufficient snow in the air to reduce visibility to less than 0.4
        kilometers (0.25 mi).[36] In Canada and the United Kingdom, the criteria
        are similar.[37][38] While heavy snowfall often occurs during blizzard
        conditions, falling snow is not a requirement, as blowing snow can
        create a ground blizzard.

      <h3>
        Snowstorm intensity may be categorized by visibility and depth of
        accumulation.[40] Snowfall's intensity is determined by visibility,
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Light: visibility greater than 1 kilometer (0.6 mi)</li>
        <li>
          Moderate: visibility restrictions between 0.5 and 1 kilometer (0.3 and
          0.6 mi)
        </li>
        <li>Heavy: visibility is less than 0.5 kilometers (0.3 mi)</li>
      </ul>

            Extraterrestrial "snow" includes water-based precipitation, but also precipitation of other compounds prevalent on other planets and moons in the Solar System. Examples are:
            <li>
                On Mars, observations of the Phoenix Mars lander reveal that water-based snow crystals occur at high latitudes.[101] Additionally, carbon dioxide precipitates from clouds during the Martian winters at the poles and contributes to a seasonal deposit of that compound, which is the principal component of that planet's ice caps.
            </li>
            <li>
                On Venus, observations from the Magellan spacecraft reveal the presence a metallic substance, which precipitates as "Venus snow" and leaves a highly reflective substance at the tops of Venus's highest mountain peaks resembling terrestrial snow. Given the high temperatures on Venus, the leading candidates for the precipitate are lead sulfide and bismuth(III) sulfide.
            </li>
            <li>
                On Saturn's moon, Titan, Cassini–Huygens spacecraft observations suggest the presence of methane or some other form of hydrocarbon-based crystalline deposits.
